Schedule Assistant history
==========================

Version beta-00001
- Started the repo and dropped in the base layout.

Version beta-00002
- Got the PySide6 shell running with role-aware login and a tiny dashboard plus the JSON account seed.

Version beta-00003
- Moved auth to salted PBKDF2, added self-serve password changes, and shipped the one-command launcher.

Version beta-00004
- Added audit logging plus a lockout flow so managers can track and clear bad attempts.

Version beta-00005
- Seeded BWW role presets, employee start dates, the SQLite layer, richer directory tools, and the ISO week picker with session timers.

Version beta-00006
- Wrapped the main window in a scroll area so layouts hold up on every screen.

Version beta-00007
- Fixed modifier math around midnight and cut tooltips down to one clear delta.

Version beta-00008
- Renamed Week Prep, stood up the Validate / Import / Export tab, brought JSON import/export online, and refreshed the theme plus roster.

Version beta-00009
- Matched the Employee Directory width to the shell, smoothed the Validate hub, tightened swap/grant UX, and shipped Policy Composer tied to the generator.

Version beta-00010
- Let Policy Composer set hours, buffers, and `@open/@close` anchors, taught the generator to honor them, and synced the docs/tests.

Version beta-00011
- Week Prep and Week Schedule now cover the full run with live data, Validate handles transfers, and the grid plus seed roster feel like the real store.

Version beta-00012
- Simplified the week picker, added a saved modifier shelf, merged policy access, added bulk delete, and tightened generator rules.

Version beta-00013
- Final cleanup before the repo push; everything is stable except the policy and schedule generator modules we will fix later.
