Schedule Assistant history
==========================

Version beta-00001
- Started the repo and dropped in the base layout.

Version beta-00002
- Got the PySide6 shell running with role-aware login and a tiny dashboard plus the JSON account seed.

Version beta-00003
- Moved auth to salted PBKDF2, added self-serve password changes, and shipped the one-command launcher.

Version beta-00004
- Added audit logging plus a lockout flow so managers can track and clear bad attempts.

Version beta-00005
- Seeded BWW role presets, employee start dates, the SQLite layer, richer directory tools, and the ISO week picker with session timers.

Version beta-00006
- Wrapped the main window in a scroll area so layouts hold up on every screen.

Version beta-00007
- Fixed modifier math around midnight and cut tooltips down to one clear delta.

Version beta-00008
- Renamed Week Prep, stood up the Validate / Import / Export tab, brought JSON import/export online, and refreshed the theme plus roster.

Version beta-00009
- Matched the Employee Directory width to the shell, smoothed the Validate hub, tightened swap/grant UX, and shipped Policy Composer tied to the generator.

Version beta-00010
- Let Policy Composer set hours, buffers, and `@open/@close` anchors, taught the generator to honor them, and synced the docs/tests.

Version beta-00011
- Week Prep and Week Schedule now cover the full run with live data, Validate handles transfers, and the grid plus seed roster feel like the real store.

Version beta-00012
- Simplified the week picker, added a saved modifier shelf, merged policy access, added bulk delete, and tightened generator rules.

Version beta-00013
- Final cleanup before the repo push; everything is stable except the policy and schedule generator modules we will fix later.

Version beta-00014
- SMs now get a system-wide warning before editing policy, every workflow action audits, and the Policy Composer picked up cross-coverage + group budget controls.
- Generator prioritizes required coverage before extras, honors the revised guardrails, and UI shifts now show “cut around” notes plus live budget gauges.
- Seed data grew past 60 employees to cover Host/Chip/Shake gaps, and the Week Schedule footer reports projected % of labor budget and projected sales consumed.

Version beta-00015
- Labor budgets now start with a global “% of projected sales” dial, and each role group claims its share—persisting across weeks and restarts.
- Policy Composer stayed manager-friendly but now exposes the global labor % and per-group percentages in one place; SM/GM/IT edits remain warning-gated and fully audited.
- Generator respects the new budget knobs, falls back across roles more intelligently, and each run introduces slight variability so multiple compliant drafts surface for review.

Version beta-00016
- Added a Role Wages manager (import/export/reset) with confirmation indicators, plus hard pre-flight checks so generation won't run until wages, employees, and projected sales are complete.
- Policy Composer now includes labor-budget tolerance sliders, and the generator enforces those budgets per role group while honoring the new wage overrides.
- Validate / Import / Export gained a wages dataset, Sunday coverage balances out with the expanded seed roster, and Week Schedule footer percentages line up with the enforced labor math.

Version beta-00017
- Policy view is now a full GUI editor: edit/save global guardrails, labor percentages (with tolerance), time blocks, and role-group allocations inline, plus import/export JSON without touching raw data.
- Removed fallback sales and min-rest fields, making projections mandatory; budget gauges now reflect real sales and the generator enforces only max hours/consecutive-day limits.
- Defined dedicated closer roles (server dining/cocktail, bartender, kitchen) so only four closers are scheduled per night with the correct close-window rules.

Version beta-00018
- Policy settings expose per-day open/mid/close hours, simplified AM/PM windows, and lean role-group percentage inputs that feed directly into the scheduler.
- Generator now understands the `@mid` anchor plus the new hours data, so AM/PM/Close coverage honors store hours without editing raw JSON.
- Week Schedule footer always shows budget percentages (even before projections), and policy exports/imports remain single-click for managers.
